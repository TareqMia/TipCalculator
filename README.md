The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes
* the main challenge was learning how to use Xcode to create the app. I did now a little bit of Swift beforehand, but working with 
Xcode and learning about the views and storyboards, along with the UI elemetns such as buttons, getting keyboard input, and segmented controls,
was pretty new to me.
* I am still pretty inexerinced when it comes to iOS development, but I tried my best to make sure that the UI layout made it so that the app 
would look similar across diffrent screens. However, I was unable to properly execute this, as the scaling looks a little off when changing to
a differnt phone screen.
