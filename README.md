## Notes

Learning to use XCode was a new challange for me. But following the examples and using other resources online, it all started to make sense. I understood how everything worked together: from the storyboard to the scripts that I was writing. 
I have learned some basic Swift before, so understanding the code wasn't too difficult. 
The app overall is very simple, and with more experience I'm sure I can add more features and make it even better.
